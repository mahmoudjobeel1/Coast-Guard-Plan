# Coast Guard Plan
The Coast Guard problem is a problem where we have a grid (3 x 3) or (4 x 4) represents a sea area and there are 1 or 2 ships each has 1 passenger, our agent (Rescue Boat) task is to try to investigate the grid, reach the ships positions and  save people by taking them to Stations. Our agent is a blind one, it doesnâ€™t know in the beginning where it should go, but it has a KB(knowledge base) which informs it of the grid objects positions.

*******************************************

## Test Case:
grid(3,3).
agent_loc(0,1).
ships_loc([[2,2],[1,2]]).
station(1,1).
capacity(1).

## Result:
- result(drop,result(left,result(pickup,result(right,result(drop,result(left,result(up,result(pickup,result(right,result(down,result(down,s0)))))))))))
- result(drop,result(left,result(pickup,result(right,result(drop,result(up,result(left,result(pickup,result(right,result(down,result(down,s0)))))))))))
- others

## Time:
